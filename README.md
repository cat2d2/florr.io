## 🚧 Build Instructions

If you don't have the prerequisites, do this:
1. Create a new GitHub account.
2. Star this repository. This is important as it enables the next step.
3. After you have starred the repository, click the + symbol.
4. Navigate to "Create a new Codespace".
5. Type in `kit2d2alt/florr.io` as the repository.

### Then follow the steps below!

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `chinese-anthos` folder:
    ```bash
    cd florrclones/chinese-anthos
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
2. Then open the (forwarded) port!

### *✨ Terminal Tips!*
- When running commands in a terminal, run them one at a time. Each new line is a new command.
- When running commands in a terminal, don't use a slash prefix. It's not MineCraft, you little kids.
- Use `ctrl` + `shift` + ` to open your terminal like a pro! (Then join the Discord and buy my coding courses to become a real pro.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Some of these scripts use Tampermonkey, so you'll need to install it.

### 1. Install Tampermonkey
